## ✨ Quick Bio

I'm Denziel — I build mobile apps with Flutter, web apps, and small IoT projects using ESP32. I enjoy turning messy ideas into clean, working prototypes and learning new tools along the way.

* 🔭 Currently: polishing a Pathfit Equipment Borrowing & Returning System (web) and a Flutter mobile app.
* 🌱 Learning: advanced Flutter patterns, state management, and reliable GPS integration for IoT.
* 💬 Ask me about: Flutter, Java, HTML/CSS/JS, ESP32, Git, and deployment.
